# Scrolllight

This tool automatically finds and enables the Scroll Lock light in connected USB keyboards.

It comes in two flavors: sudo and nosudo. `scrolllight\_sudo.sh` will ask for a password upon running, but does not require any external dependencies. `scrolllight\_nosudo.sh` will need `light` (http://haikarainen.github.io/light/) installed, but does not ask for a password.
